* Funtions in programming is similar to functions in mathematics
  > int funct() { }
  > f(x) = x + 5
  
* Principle of mathematical induction
  > Prove that formula holds true for 1
  > Assume that the formula is true for n = k
  > Prove that formula holds true for n = k + 1
  
* Steps in recursion
  > Expectation
  > Faith
  > Can you express expectations in terms of faith?
  
* Thinking
  > High level thinking : recursive case
  > Low level thinking : base case
  
* Print decreasing sequence from n to 1
  
  void func(int n) {
    if(n==0) return;
    cout << n << " ";
    func(n-1);
  }
