* Linked List is the 2+2 of data structures

* edges cases you need to check to avoid NULL point exception
  > n = 0 : head is null
  > n = 1 : linked list with one node
  > n = 2 : linked list with 2 nodes
  > n = odd : linked list with odd number of nodes
  > n = even : linked list with even number of nodes
  
* Avoid using extra space
* Linked list is used because it does not use continuous memory
* Solve linked list problems using O(1) space

* Most important function 
  > Middle of linked list
  > Reverse pointer of linked list
  > Remove first
  > Add first
  > Add last
  
* Break your code in functions
* It becomes easier to work with pointers

* Make dummy nodes with some value instead of NULL nodes
* Helps in avoiding NULL checks
