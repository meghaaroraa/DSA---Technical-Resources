- FLOW
  * methods to think for a recursive problem
  * why making the input smaller is popular
  * printing numbers from 1 to n
  
- Approaches to solve a recursive problem
  * recursive tree (decisions)
  * bace condition - induction - hypothesis (making input smaller)
  * choice diagram (DP)
  * 
  
- Hypothesis approach
  * base condition
    - smallest valid input
    - largest invalid input
    
- print numbers from 1 to n
  * input : n
  * output : 1 2 ... n
  * hypothesis
    - print(n) 1 to n 
    - print(n-1) 1 to n-1
  * induction
    - cout << n << " "
  * base condition : smallest valid input (1)
