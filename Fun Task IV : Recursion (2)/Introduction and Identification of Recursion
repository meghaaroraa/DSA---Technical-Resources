* JEDI ban jao recursion ke

* FLOW
  - make input smaller
  - Decision space
  - Recursive tree - sole of recursion
  - 2 steps to colve any recursive problem
  
* MAKE INPUT SMALLER
  - hum input ko deliberatly small nahi krte
  - unconsciously ho jaata hai
  - we take some steps which in turn make the input smaller
  
* DECISION SPACE
  - used for indentification
  - recursive problem hai ke nahi
  
* RECURSIVE TREE
  - designing a recursive with respect to the givne problem
  - recursive tree identify kar liya toh writing the code will be a peice of cake
