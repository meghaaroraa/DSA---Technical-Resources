* Drawback of singly linked list -> cannot travel backwards

* Can travel in both directions
* Doubly linked list has 2 pointers 
  > next : forward traversal in linked list
  > previous : backwards traversal in linked lsit
  
* benefits : easier to insert nodes in between of linked list
* drawbacks : previous pointer needs extra space

* Functions in doubly linked list :
  > addFirst(x)
  > addLast(x)
  > addAfterNode(x, node)
  
  > removeFirst()
  > removeLast()
  > removeNode(node)
  
  > getFirst()
  > getLast()
  > getAt(idx)
  
  > size()
  > isEmpty()
  > clear()
